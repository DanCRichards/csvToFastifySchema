# csvToFastifySchema
A program to convert CSV files to Fastify Schemas


## Author: Dan Richards 

## Purpose: 
To convert CSV files with a specified format to fastify SchemaObjects to allow for quicker code generation of Fastify Schemas. 

> Your team might build API specs in Excel or another spreadsheet document software and a process might require the mapping of those spreadsheets to fastify based APIs. This helps with automating that. 


## Usage:
```npm run start *file location of your input file* ```

## Roadmap: 

1. Get it working!
2. Convert to Typescript!
3. Add customisable mappings between CSVs and SchemaObject fields 
4. TESTS!
5. Abstract the services
    - This will allow for different input types and mappings between inputs and outputs. 
6. Document the code 



## Bug Reporting
